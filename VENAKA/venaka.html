He appears as a red, flesh-like humanoid that can kill fast and traverse fast. He is known for his association with a vandalization group called "team c00lkidd". c00lkidd is a purchasable Killer in Forsaken. He is an exploiter with a childlike personality who treats his situation very playfully and game-like, often laughing while active.

                            c00lkidd originates from an exploiter by the same name, reported to have vandalized a variety of games (notably Natural Disaster Survival & Work at a Pizza Place) by plastering a decal of their avatar all over the map and making the games unplayable. <br>
                        <br>
                        c00lkidd is a Chase/Rushdown killer. His kit consists of one ranged move, a long-lasting mobility, and a player tracking move. All these moves can be used to catch players off guard (specifically while they are doing tasks). He mainly plays aggressively with his high damage</p>

                        <p class="info">A man whose identity is concealed by a crude hockey mask. Wielding various tools and driven by a thirst for the cat-and-mouse chase, his hands and weapons are always stained with blood. He enters his damnation armed with his infamous machete and a chainsaw he found in a cabin. Jason (Full Name: Jason Voorhees) is the first killer available to all players, unlocked when joining the game for the first time. He is a savage and ruthless killer, driven by mysterious motives for his actions. Jason is equipped with various tools to kill his victims, with his iconic machete serving as his primary weapon.

                            Jason originates from the popular horror movie franchise Friday The 13th, though his specific design is based on the old version of Jason from the Roblox game Survive and Kill the Killers in Area 51.
                            <br><br> Jason is a Melee Range/Stealth killer. He lacks ranged abilities, forcing him to rely heavily on close-quarters combat. His kit focuses on offensive skills that deal significant damage to targets. His signature effect, Bleeding, inflicts damage over time on survivors. His precise hitboxes make him particularly effective in close-range encounters.</p>

An unstoppable force entering the round with a strategical mindset, he's able to set traps, summon walls to back survivors into a corner, and leave behind a faint trail that damages those who step on it.
                            John Doe is one of the many Killers currently available, purchasable for 1,000 Player Points. John Doe has fused himself with the defunct old Roblox code and will now kill anyone who stands in his path, determined to destroy all of Roblox.
John Doe is the 2nd Roblox user to join Roblox, being a test account in 2005. He is known for the urban legend that he and Jane Doe would destroy Roblox on March 18th, 2017. 
<br><br> John Doe can be considered one of, if not the most technical killer currently in the game. John Doe's playstyle is mainly setplay, trapping and cornering survivors to kill them swiftly and easily. It requires patience to either trap players or kill them with some of the abilities. He is quite hard to use, but if mastered, pays off extremely well

                            Two Time focuses on a more solo approach as they have no abilities that benefit their team, making them cannon fodder to distract the killer from their allies. They are planned to get a rework sometime in the future and will gain abilities. Their passive ability is named Undying Devotion. It is not recommended to use Two Time if you're more focused on teamwork, since having no abilities makes them an easy target.</p>
